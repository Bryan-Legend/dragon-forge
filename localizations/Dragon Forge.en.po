msgid "Greetings, I am Frapvas."
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you ever dug for any gemstones, dragon?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As hard as it is, it’s always worth it, even when you can't find any of the "
"precious metals."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nothing is more rewarding than hard work."
msgstr ""

msgid "So what is it like to be able to fly?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do your wings ever get tired?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you think there are dragons who are afraid of heights?"
msgstr ""

msgid "How fast can you go?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh, I’m sorry for all the annoying questions."
msgstr ""

msgid "I just wish I could fly like you."
msgstr ""

msgid "Someone should invent a machine that can make you fly!"
msgstr ""

msgid "That would be awesome!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Be careful when you go for a swim."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you run out of energy you could drown. Even I know that."
msgstr ""

msgid "Another day, another long day in the mines."
msgstr ""

msgid "Whew! It’s a lot of work, but it’s worth it."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can forge and craft all sorts of things in this kingdom."
msgstr ""

msgid "You’ll need to in order to survive."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can use different materials to forge buildings to help you craft."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can forge iron and all sorts of materials."
msgstr ""

msgid "It’s hard work, but be patient! It’s worth it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Greetings. I am Xeart! It's spelled X-E-A-R-T."
msgstr ""

msgid "It’s an honor to have you as our guest, dragon!"
msgstr ""

msgid "The town of Mudbury has been here for generations."
msgstr ""

msgid "It’s small and simple, but it is our home."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Still, it hasn't felt quite right without the mighty dragons flying in the "
"skies."
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe now that you’re here, it can eventually go back to normal?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The best part about living in a mining town is that there is always work to "
"be done."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unfortunately, that is also kind of the worst part..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bisbee is a wonderful place to live in."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Who would have ever thought that such a wonderful place would be in such a "
"terrible desert?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello, I am Ank."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It’s on days like this that I almost wish we were attacked by evil-doers!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I’ve never been so bored in my entire life."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I’ve lived in Gloombury all my life, and I can’t even remember the last time "
"I saw a dragon."
msgstr ""

msgid "We are lucky to have you as our guest."
msgstr ""

msgid "The swamp has lots to explore if you're brave enough to look."
msgstr ""

msgid "This windmill helps to provide energy to all of Mudbury."
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you fought in many battles, dragon?"
msgstr ""

msgid "When I’m not here in the market, I’m out practicing my swordplay."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can never be too prepared to conquer evil."
msgstr ""

msgid "You may be tempted to think that the goblins of Bisbee are greedy."
msgstr ""

msgid "Be honest, you have had that assumption, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Fortunately, despite what you would think, we are humble goblins."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It turns out that when you spend all of your time digging up valuable "
"gemstones, they start to become just another boring part of life!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Aye, it’s not about the riches, but the hunt for them that excites us."
msgstr ""

msgid "When you defeat a golem, it leaves behind a soul gem."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can use them to craft or trade with other goblins."
msgstr ""

msgid "I should know, I’ve had to battle many golems in my day."
msgstr ""

msgid "Aye, I’m lucky to survive every time."
msgstr ""

msgid "One night, while I was on guard duty, a stoneogre attacked me."
msgstr ""

msgid "It grabbed me and it almost put me in his mouth."
msgstr ""

msgid "His breath smelled disgusting!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I used my sword to escape his grasp and I defeated him."
msgstr ""

msgid "I learned a valuable lesson that night."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a stoneorge kills me, hopefully it stomps on me before it eats me, because "
"I never want to be near that terrible smell again."
msgstr ""

msgid "What? A dragon? Here? I’ve seen it all now."
msgstr ""

msgid "I’ve sailed all over the sea, and I haven’t seen a dragon in years."
msgstr ""

msgid "Aye, pardon me! The name is Kur, the dockmaster of Mudbury."
msgstr ""

msgid "No ship sails through these waters without me knowing about it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Wait... you don’t need a boat…\n"
" because you have wings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Aye, maybe you could help old Kur?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"My best boat is under repairs, and I need an important message delivered."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Have you heard of Gloombury Town? It’s in Grimbreak Swamp to the south east "
"of here."
msgstr ""

msgid "Could you please deliver a message to a goblin named Dark Johnny?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I’ll give you a reward if you do so.\n"
"It’s a secret code, so tell no one but Dark Johnny!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here is the message,\n"
"“Open your ears, and you’ll hear the crashing of the waves on the rocks.”\n"
msgstr ""

msgid "Good luck, and thank you."
msgstr ""

msgid "Can you see Grimbreak Swamp over there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It’s a revolting place, full of guuls and other creatures."
msgstr ""

msgid "But so many goblins choose to live there in the town of Gloombury."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I can barely stand to look at that swamp from this tower, but to actually "
"live there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I don’t get it, but I suppose home is home."
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you ever heard of Pablo the goblin?"
msgstr ""

msgid "He was the architect who designed most of Ravenside Village."
msgstr ""

msgid "He worked with all the goblins to make this a reality."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Can you imagine what it would be like if the stoneogres lived on the mountain "
"back then?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The goblins could never have finished Ravenside, and Pablo’s brilliance would "
"have been wasted."
msgstr ""

msgid "What is evil preventing us from accomplishing today?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ha, I don’t know, it just makes me wonder?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Greetings, I am Phafa."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hey, is this your first time visiting Gloombury?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a great place to live, and don’t let anyone else tell you otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are all sorts of wild myths about giant sea monsters who live here, but "
"it’s all nonsense."
msgstr ""

msgid "I’ve even heard rumours of a witch who lives in the swamp somewhere."
msgstr ""

msgid "Isn’t that absurd?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Welcome to Gloombury, dragon."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Don’t let the name fool you, you’ll never find less-gloomy goblins than the "
"ones who live here."
msgstr ""

msgid "“Work hard, work together” is our motto."
msgstr ""

msgid "Well...it’s not really, but hopefully it’ll catch on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you’re looking for more materials to craft, you should be able to find "
"some Copper Ore out in the swamp."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you attack some rocks with your fire, I know you’ll be able to get plenty."
msgstr ""

msgid "You sure are lucky that you can fly, dragon."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Years ago, I used to live in Gloombury, and I had to climb up this mountain "
"every morning so I could go to work."
msgstr ""

msgid "My knees would hurt all day long."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the darkness covered the land, I had no choice but to live here "
"permanently."
msgstr ""

msgid "It was too dangerous to travel."
msgstr ""

msgid "I often miss my old home."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is so hot today!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I love living here in Summerscar Desert, but the heat can be unbearable at "
"times."
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you ever heard of the Loranis Ice Shelf?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It’s this giant block of ice where it is always freezing cold."
msgstr ""

msgid "Aye, that’s the legend anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "I wish I could go there to avoid this horrible heat."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello, I am Morx."
msgstr ""

msgid "Believe it or not, I rarely work in the mines."
msgstr ""

msgid "Aye, my true passion is cooking."
msgstr ""

msgid "I made all of this bread by myself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It’s not easy being the one cook in Bisbee, but at least I’m never bored!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello. I am Glin."
msgstr ""

msgid "Are you hungry? Ugh, because I am.\n"
msgstr ""

msgid "Let me tell you, if there is one thing goblins love, it’s food."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While on your quest, keep an eye out for ingredients like flour, butter, "
"cheese, or even jerky."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can use food to improve your health, or even to trade with others."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can even learn some new recipes with what you gathered."
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh great, now I’m even more hungry."
msgstr ""

msgid "I’m Leer, and I’m on guard duty in this valley."
msgstr ""

msgid "It can be lonely sometimes, but I don’t mind."
msgstr ""

msgid "When a job is hard to do, it makes success that much more wonderful."
msgstr ""

msgid "Please, young dragon, be careful as you travel here!"
msgstr ""

msgid "The dangerous demons and ifrits of this land will show you no mercy!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I barely feel qualified to even serve here as a soldier! Please, we need you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you spoken to Piank, over there on the dock?"
msgstr ""

msgid "He might have a quest to ask of you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I’m jealous of him, I would rather be guarding the dock than guard this gray "
"building."
msgstr ""

msgid "Couldn’t they have at least added some colors to this house?"
msgstr ""

msgid "The name is Gnurt, and I like to make deals."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is my deal to you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bring me ropes, and I’ll give you five iron ore for each one."
msgstr ""

msgid "That’s my deal, dragon."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hey! What's the deal?"
msgstr ""

msgid "You don't have any ropes!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello, I’m Wog."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is where I always volunteer to take guard duty."
msgstr ""

msgid "There tends to be a lot less stoneogres on this side of the mountain."
msgstr ""

msgid "I once tried to fight one, and it almost stomped on me!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I’ve had nightmares about them ever since."
msgstr ""

msgid "Is it someone new? It is!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And a dragon at that! Welcome to Molten Island, home of the Pantheon of "
"Regrets and Mount Moltenfury!\n"
msgstr ""

msgid "I can’t remember the last time anyone has visited Molten Island."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Only the bravest enter here, for it is the most dangerous part of the "
"Kingdom.\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Years ago, whenever a dragon came of age, they would fly here to the Pantheon "
"of Regrets."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A young dragon would stay there for a whole day, surviving all on its own. "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It would defeat any of the fire demons and ifrits that dared to attack it!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But most importantly, it would be through this trial that the dragon would "
"learn what it means to be a protector of the Kingdom."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After one ferocious day, the dragon would return and be accepted as a warrior."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But now… all that remains here is this darkness, which the fire demons have "
"taken control of."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It’s too dangerous for even an important rite of passage to take place.\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Young dragon, my fellow goblins and I can only do so much to further protect "
"Mount Moltenfury."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you could free this land of darkness, we would be in your debt!  "
msgstr ""

msgid "Whew, it’s hot today, isn’t it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Well, more hot than usual!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Just when I think I’m used to the heat of this desert, the sun somehow "
"decides to become even hotter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Isn’t the view incredible from up here?"
msgstr ""

msgid "The desert looks like it goes on forever."
msgstr ""

msgid "Aye, Summerscar Desert is a massive place. "
msgstr ""

msgid "Has anyone warned you of the golems who live in the desert?"
msgstr ""

msgid "They are terrible monsters who feast upon the souls of their victims."
msgstr ""

msgid "It’s true, they don’t just feast on meat like any other monster."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is the creature’s soul that they want to feast on!"
msgstr ""

msgid "That’s the legend anyway, but I believe it to be true."
msgstr ""

msgid "It’s tough being assigned to stand guard by the sea."
msgstr ""

msgid "Just being next to the ocean makes me long to explore."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello, I’m Krekvirt."
msgstr ""

msgid "Of all the towns in this kingdom, Gloombury is not the most popular."
msgstr ""

msgid "But for any goblin who lives here, it’s home."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first goblins who settled here were fisher-goblins or hunters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They would hunt all kinds of wild animals, and the fishing was unbelievable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The town grew with time, and goblins still call Gloombury their home to this "
"day."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hi there, I’m Pict."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One thing I love about Ravenside Village is the view we have from up here."
msgstr ""

msgid "There is no other view like it in all the world."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can almost see the entire kingdom!"
msgstr ""

msgid "The other goblins look like little green peas from up here."
msgstr ""

msgid "It’s almost like you can fly! Have-"
msgstr ""

msgid "....."
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh. Whoops. Sorry, I forgot I was talking to a...heh-heh, sorry."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ugh! It is so HOT over here!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I can’t stand being surrounded by all of this heat!\n"
msgstr ""

msgid "I’m sweating like crazy over here!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello, I am Mols, and I hope you like visiting Bisbee."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you know who Bisbee was named after?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is named after Bisbee the goblin, who was the first goblin to become a "
"miner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He lived thousands of years ago, and we all hope to be worthy of his name. "
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello there! I am Flens!"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is wonderful to have you here."
msgstr ""

msgid "We haven’t had any visitors here in ages!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And for good reason! Molten Island is home to all sorts of demons and ifrits!"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is dangerous here. Please be mindful!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello, dragon. I am Dolect."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It’s my job to maintain this well, and to provide clean water to all the "
"goblins."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In a swamp as disgusting as Grimbreak Swamp, a source of clean water couldn’t "
"be more important."
msgstr ""

msgid "Gotzard is the name, dragon."
msgstr ""

msgid "I’m on guard duty."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It’s painfully dull on this side of the town, but someone has to be here, eh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When I get too bored, I remind myself that enemies can attack right when I "
"choose to close my eyes."
msgstr ""

msgid "I’ll tell you, that keeps me from ignoring my job, I’ll say."
msgstr ""

msgid "The other day, I found all sorts of new materials to craft with."
msgstr ""

msgid "I was thinking of smelting it all to make some bronze."
msgstr ""

msgid "I’ve never made bronze before, only copper and other metals."
msgstr ""

msgid "The possibilities are almost endless, and I just love it."
msgstr ""

msgid "I’m Throsh the gardener, it’s a pleasure to meet you."
msgstr ""

msgid "I’m one of the only goblins who doesn’t work in the mines."
msgstr ""

msgid "Aye, my job is to work in the garden."
msgstr ""

msgid "I can feel like a bit of an outcast at times, but it doesn’t matter!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I just love gardening, and that’s what really matters."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello, I’m Luilish."
msgstr ""

msgid "I decided to climb up this tower today."
msgstr ""

msgid "I think it will make for some good exercise."
msgstr ""

msgid "You know, Summerscar Desert is a dangerous place."
msgstr ""

msgid "It’s very hot, and you can run into an evil golem."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But I don’t think there is anywhere more dangerous than the Molten Island."
msgstr ""

msgid "I will never go over to that place."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now that I think about it, I think dragons used to go there for some reason?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you ever seen an actual Guul, dragon?"
msgstr ""

msgid "They are the most terrifying monsters you’ll ever see."
msgstr ""

msgid "I saw one while hunting in the swamp the other day."
msgstr ""

msgid "I was so scared that I ran back to town immediately."
msgstr ""

msgid "I’m just going to buy food from the market for a while... "
msgstr ""

msgid "Aren’t these bones mysterious?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Goblin scientists believe that these creatures might have been sea monsters "
"of some kind."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They believe that centuries ago, this island didn’t even exist, and this was "
"all part of the ocean."
msgstr ""

msgid "But now all that remains of these sea monsters are these skeletons."
msgstr ""

msgid "Aye, This desert holds all sorts of great mysteries like this."
msgstr ""

msgid "I’ve had to fight all sorts of guul’s here in Grimbreak Swamp."
msgstr ""

msgid "I’ve had many of my bones broken at some point in time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It’s been rough, but I’ll give up everything to protect this swamp from evil."
msgstr ""

msgid "Isn’t it amazing being at the very top of the mountain like this?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I love living on Mount Algar."
msgstr ""

msgid "The air is clear, and the sky is always beautiful."
msgstr ""

msgid "When I’m here, I never want to go down."
msgstr ""

msgid "It reminds me of why we fight to protect this mountain from evil."
msgstr ""

msgid "I found these mushrooms in the bushes here in the swamp.\t"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We need some stone to keep our house from sinking.\n"
"Want to trade?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sorry, I know stones are super hard to find, but you don't seem to have any."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you know what Ichor is, dragon?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ichor is the green stuff we use to make poison out of, among other things."
msgstr ""

msgid "It can only be found in Grimbreak Swamp."
msgstr ""

msgid "There is just one problem."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to get Ichor, you need to defeat some guul’s in battle, then you "
"collect the Ichor that they left behind."
msgstr ""

msgid "It’s not easy, but it’s the only way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before the darkness took over, Ravenside Village used to host lots of fun "
"activities."
msgstr ""

msgid "Did you know that goblins used to have flying races with dragons?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It’s true, we would have a giant flying contest every year."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Goblins would train birds to let us fly on their backs, and we would race "
"against dragons like you."
msgstr ""

msgid "I saw it myself, when I was just a young lad."
msgstr ""

msgid "It was great fun. How I miss those days."
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you seen Blerx?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I don’t trust that guy."
msgstr ""

msgid "It always feels like he’s watching me."
msgstr ""

msgid "The goblins in Bisbee are some of the best warriors you’ll ever meet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Over the years, many enemies have tried to steal some of our precious metals."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We are famous for all of the Turquoise and Bronze that we find in the mines."
msgstr ""

msgid "It’s only natural for evil to try and take it for themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid "But evil is no match for the goblins of Bisbee."
msgstr ""

msgid "Aye, dragon! I’m glad you came up here.\n"
msgstr ""

msgid "I always come up here because I can see all of Mudbury from up here."
msgstr ""

msgid "You’re lucky that you have wings so you can see from all over."
msgstr ""

msgid "When you’re a goblin, you’ got to think smart."
msgstr ""

msgid "Before I lived here, I lived in almost every other town on the island."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nowhere ever felt right, but once I found Bisbee? I found my home."
msgstr ""

msgid "Greetings, I am Jinks."
msgstr ""

msgid "Aren’t these emeralds beautiful?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I’m one of the architects here at Bisbee."
msgstr ""

msgid "I find all of my materials here in Summerscar Desert."
msgstr ""

msgid "Turquoise, Mica...among many other gems."
msgstr ""

msgid "Aye! There are great minerals to craft with out there."
msgstr ""

msgid "I believe my son is somewhere by the mine entrance."
msgstr ""

msgid "I wish I could make him understand the beauty of crafting."
msgstr ""

msgid "But regardless, he’s still a great young goblin."
msgstr ""

msgid "Greetings!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Aye, welcome to Bisbee."
msgstr ""

msgid "We are a world-famous mining town!"
msgstr ""

msgid "We find the greatest metals in the whole desert."
msgstr ""

msgid "We’re lucky to have you, dragon."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello, dragon."
msgstr ""

msgid "You’re in Scuttlebutt Hideout..."
msgstr ""

msgid "...and you’re lucky we’re letting you visit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This hideout has been used by goblins to hide from enemies for generations."
msgstr ""

msgid "You’re no goblin, but I sense no evil in you."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your presence is allowed for now."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you could help us protect the forest, we would be beyond thankful."
msgstr ""

msgid "I hear you can use the Mouse Wheel to zoom the camera in and out.\t"
msgstr ""

msgid "Uh... what's a zoom, anyways?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This tower used to be our watchtower, but no goblin ever uses it anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you get to the top, all you can see is the darkness and all of Grimbreak "
"Swamp."
msgstr ""

msgid "There isn’t much to see!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some goblins want to tear it down, but I don’t know, I’m quite fond of this "
"tower."
msgstr ""

msgid "This tower holds the armory for all goblins."
msgstr ""

msgid "Goblins may be small, but we’re always prepared for a fight."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One nice thing about keeping guard by this beach is that I don’t have to "
"fight minotaurs and orcs as often as other goblin soldiers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Those monsters give me the creeps like nothing else."
msgstr ""

msgid "It makes me sad to look at all the ruins near here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It makes me wish I was old enough to see Spikeridge Forest before this "
"darkness ruled the land."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you think your kind will ever return?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I hope so, dragon."
msgstr ""

msgid "A few years ago, I was on guard duty on this bridge."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I looked out into Summerscar Desert, and I saw a thirsty goblin crawling on "
"his hands and knees."
msgstr ""

msgid "Isn’t that terrible?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I immediately let my fellow goblins know and we ran out to save him."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The poor Goblin was from Gloombury, and he went out for a hike in the desert."
msgstr ""

msgid "The poor fool forgot his map, and he was lost for 3 whole days."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If I didn’t see him, he either would have died from thirst, or eaten by "
"golems."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ever since then, I take guard duty very seriously!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I’m proud to keep guard here in Spikeridge Forest."
msgstr ""

msgid "I love being surrounded by nature, it feels like being home."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I would hate to see these trees cut down so it could be turned into a town "
"like Mudbury."
msgstr ""

msgid "This forest has been through enough already."
msgstr ""

msgid "My grandfather was one of the founders of Bisbee."
msgstr ""

msgid "Aye, he even helped to craft this factory."
msgstr ""

msgid "I can’t even imagine all of the sacrifices he made."
msgstr ""

msgid "I miss my grandfather, but at least this factory reminds me of him."
msgstr ""

msgid "I wish all of these guul’s would just leave the swamp alone!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I haven’t been able to go fishing for a few weeks now."
msgstr ""

msgid "And I really love to fish!"
msgstr ""

msgid "You would never guess it, but we all like living in a swamp."
msgstr ""

msgid "Once you get used to all the bugs, it’s really not that bad."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello dragon, I am Krel."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I hope you’re prepared to fight any of the orcs and minotaurs that dwell in "
"this forest."
msgstr ""

msgid "That's how this evil curse has continued to haunt us for so long."

msgid "In the next field, you will find Zygo, the king of the skeletons."

msgid "But alas, once the darkness swept through the land, I had to hide."
msgstr ""

msgid "Every monster king searched for me, but they never found me."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I now lead this kingdom not from a castle, but while hiding in the shadows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I only speak with my subjects secretly, so the monsters can't destroy me."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

"Shortly after becoming the king, I had to protect Fangblight from an army of "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They were trying to invade Bisbee, and I traveled with my goblin army to "

msgid "He is the king of the liches, but he has no given name."
msgstr ""

msgid "The liches only call him \\\"The Dead One\\\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Dead One is a vicious, unfeeling monstrosity."
msgstr ""

msgid "It will be a tough battle, but with you, I know he has met his match."
msgstr ""

msgid "Good luck, hero!"

msgid "The Dead One has been vanquished forever."

msgstr ""

msgid "As scary as that is, you shouldn't be afraid."
msgstr ""

msgid "Look at all you have done, hero!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You have swept away almost all of the darkness of my kingdom. Keep going, "
